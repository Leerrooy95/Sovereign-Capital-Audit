# Phase 0 Sources: Documentation & Methodology

## Overview
This directory contains the forensic reconstruction of the "Phase 0" genesis event of the Asymmetric Alliance. Unlike traditional narratives that place the start of this phenomenon in the mid-2010s, this data identifies the **2008 Financial Crisis** as the structural starting point.

The evidence is categorized into two vectors:
1.  **The Foreign Capture:** The acquisition of U.S. semiconductor assets by sovereign wealth funds.
2.  **The Domestic Reset:** The financial near-collapse and radical pivot of the U.S. "Oligarch Layer."

## Vector 1: The Foreign Capture (AMD & GlobalFoundries)

The primary evidence for the transfer of U.S. manufacturing sovereignty to the UAE (ATIC/Mubadala) relies on SEC filings, contemporary financial reporting, and Department of Defense records regarding the "Trusted Foundry" program.

## Cultural Signals (The Zeitgeist of 2008)
To understand the *psychological* permissiveness of the era, we track cultural markers of institutional distrust.

* **Bitcoin Genesis Block (Jan 3, 2009):** [News on Genesis Block Message](https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-genesis-block-fifteeth-birthday). The embedded message "Chancellor on brink of second bailout" signals the rejection of central banking.
* **The Simpsons ("E Pluribus Wiggum"):** Aired Jan 6, 2008. Satirizes the hollowed-out political establishment susceptible to populism.
